Brief Description of Goal of Code:
This code is meant to operate as a web-based diagnostic app, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The user is presented with a series of Yes/No questions to determine if their injury-related symptoms are more
consistent with an ankle sprain or fracture. However, it should be noted that this code IS NOT designed
to diagnose any medical conditions.
 
Known Issues:
blah, blah, blah, blah
